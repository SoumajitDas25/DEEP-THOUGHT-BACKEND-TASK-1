# Overview

This repository contains two tasks as part of my internship assignment. Below is a brief description of each task:

## Task 1: Event CRUD API Implementation

In this task, I've implemented a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing events. The application is built using Node.js and MongoDB. The main functionalities include:

- **Create:** Add a new event.
- **Read:** Retrieve details of all events or a specific event.
- **Update:** Modify details of an existing event.
- **Delete:** Remove an event from the system.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Task 2: API Documentation for Nudge

This task involves creating API documentation for the "Nudge" service. The documentation provides details about the available endpoints, request parameters, payloads and expected responses.

### Documentation Overview

- **API Structure**: Tabular description which includes the types of requests, Base URL, API Endpoints, Payload and the description about the API.
- **Object Data Model**: JSON Formatted data model for a Nudge document.
- **CRUD Functionalities Documentation**: Description about each CRUD operation.

### Accessing the Documentation

You can find the API documentation in the `Backend Tasks/ Task 2 - API Documentation` directory.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to implement backend services and document APIs effectively. For any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
